#AHK
AHK Scripts used to enhance windows experience.

##Instructions
Launch "AHK Startup.ahk" to run all scripts in the "Startup" directory. Use the "compile_ahk.bat" to compile the startup scripts as exe files for use on computers that do not have AHK installed, like for this [USB on the go project](https://github.com/cjsimon/usb_programs).
